# Faulty-Calc
A fun and unpredictable calculator that works correctly 90% of the time — and gives completely random results the other 10%!

A simple yet mischievous web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations — but with a twist!
While it works correctly 90% of the time, there’s always a 10% chance it will give you a completely wrong (and random) answer.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project blends logic, randomness, and fun to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional programming in a creative way.

🔧 Features:-

Performs basic arithmetic operations:

➕ Addition (+)

➖ Subtraction (-)

✖️ Multiplication (*)

➗ Division (/)

Randomly produces incorrect results 10% of the time

Clean, minimal, and responsive user interface

Interactive button-based input

Great beginner-friendly project to understand:

JavaScript event listeners

Randomization using Math.random()

Updating the DOM dynamically

⚙️ How It Works:-

The user enters two numbers and selects an operation (+, -, *, or /).

The calculator performs the operation normally.

A random number generator decides if the result will be correct or faulty:

If random value > 0.1 → ✅ Correct Result

If random value ≤ 0.1 → ❌ Incorrect Result (random wrong value)

The output is then displayed on the calculator screen.

This introduces a playful “uncertainty factor,” making it a fun experiment rather than a reliable calculator.

🖥️ Tech Stack:-

HTML5 — structure of the calculator

CSS3 — styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) — main logic and randomization
